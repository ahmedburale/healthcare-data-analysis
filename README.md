# Healthcare Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze synthetic healthcare data and build a machine learning model to predict test results based on various factors such as age, gender, and medical condition.

## Dataset

The dataset contains synthetic healthcare records with the following fields:
- Patient Name
- Age
- Gender
- Blood Type
- Medical Condition
- Date of Admission
- Doctor Name
- Hospital Name
- Insurance Provider
- Billing Amount
- Room Number
- Admission Type
- Discharge Date
- Medication
- Test Results

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Cleaning**: Standardize column names, correct data types, and handle missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the distribution of age, gender, medical conditions, admission types, and test results.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Encode categorical variables, create new features such as the length of hospital stay, and drop unnecessary columns.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.
5. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Train a Random Forest classifier and evaluate its performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. Visualize feature importance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `healthcare_analysis.ipynb` notebook to see the analysis and model building steps.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the data distribution and relationships between features. The Random Forest classifier model predicts test results with a certain accuracy, and the feature importance plot shows which features contribute the most to the predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and analyzing healthcare data, performing exploratory data analysis, and building a predictive model using machine learning techniques.
