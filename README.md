# Healthcare Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This project aims to analyze synthetic healthcare data and build a machine learning model to predict test results based on various factors such as age, gender, and medical condition.

## Dataset
The dataset contains synthetic healthcare records with information about patients' demographics, medical conditions, admissions, treatments, and test results.

## Project Structure
- `Healthcare-Dataset-Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and modeling code.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Setup
To run the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
